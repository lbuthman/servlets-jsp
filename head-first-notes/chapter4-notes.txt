- A servlet's job is to take a client's request and sent back a response.

- A servlet's lifecycle is one of
    -> initialized, being initialized, being destroyed, or doesn't exist

- The Container's role in a servlet lifecycle
    -> User clicks a URL to a servlet
    -> The Container sees the request is for a servlet so creates a HttpServletResponse and
    HttpServletRequest objects
    -> Container finds correct servlet based on URL, creates/allocates thread, calls servlet's
    service method passing in request and response objects
    -> etc.

- Servlet service methods, inherited from HttpServlet, are overridden to provide functionality

- Servlet classes are instantiated and initialized when the container starts or "just-in-time"

- POST has a body while GET does not. In other words, both have a Request header but only POST
has a body (payload). GET shows its parameters in the URL, and because of this the web page can
be bookmarked. GET is used to get data, POST is used to read/update data.

- POST is not idempotent since the data submitted might not be reversible. Idempotent generally
means a request can be made twice without negative consequences on the server.

- GET is always used in an <a> tag href hyperlink, while method="POST" is used for POST. Not
specifying a method will result in a GET request and could result in an error if the wrong
doGet() or doPost() gets called.

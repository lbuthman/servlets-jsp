- Four steps to hands-on project
    1) Review user's view (what the browser displays) and the high level architecture
    2) Create the development environment
    3) Create the deployment environment
    4) Perform Test-Driven Development

1a) HTML Page that generates HTTP Post request w/ params -- Return JSP

1b) client requests form.html -> container retrieves form.html -> container returns form.html
  -> browser sends request data to container -> container finds correct servlet based on URL
  and passes request to servlet -> servlet calls class -> class returns "answer" and servlet
  adds it to the request object -> servlet forwards request to JSP -> JSP gets answer from
  request object -> JSP generates page for the container -> container returns page to the user

2) and 3) -> follow the directory structure in the book, not an necessarily an industry standard

4) a) Build and test the HTML
   b) Build and test v.1 of the controller servlet
   c) Build and test model class
   d) Upgrade servlet to v.2 to call model and get result
   e) Build JSP, upgrade to servlet v.3 and test

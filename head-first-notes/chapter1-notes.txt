- The structure of an HTTP conversation is Request/Response

- Request Stream: HTTP Method, page to access (URL), and form parameters

- Response Stream: Status code, content-type, and content

- HTTP Methods -> GET, POST, HEAD, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and CONNECT

- Payload -> message body (of POST request)

- MIME type -> the content type response headers value, it relates to the "accept type" found
in the client request

- A web server only dishes out static html; to generate dynamic sites, it relies on helper apps

- A DD -> deployment descriptor
    -- one per web application
    -- can declare many servlets
    -- a <servlet-name> ties the <servlet> to the <servlet-mapping> element.
    -- a <servlet-class> is the Java class
    -- a <url-pattern> is the name the client uses for the request

- A JSP page looks just like an HTML page, except you can put Java code inside it
